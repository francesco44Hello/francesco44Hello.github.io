             <em>De Rossi joined the Roma youth system from Ostia Mare, where he had played as a striker, in 2000. He made his first-team debut for Roma under manager Fabio Capello on 10 October 2001 against Belgian side Anderlecht in the UEFA Champions League.In his first season with the club, he also made three appearances in the Coppa Italia. The following season, he made his Serie A debut on 25 January 2003 against Como. Later that season, his first Serie A start, along with his first league and career goal, came on 10 May 2003 against Torino.

               <em>In the 2006–07 season, De Rossi continued to be a decisive player for the team,scoring from 40 yards against Fiorentina on 5 November 2006, with Sébastien Frey in goal. This was the first of three goals of the night for Roma, as they won the match 3–1. He also scored the lone Roma goal in Roma's Champions League quarter-final defeat against Manchester United in the 2006–07 season.[20] On 9 May 2007, De Rossi scored in Roma's 6–2 first leg victory of the 2007 Coppa Italia final over Internazionale,<u> as Roma went on to win the trophy on aggregate.</u>

         <em>Following <strong>Francesco Totti</strong>'s retirement, <u>De Rossi inherited the captain's armband ahead of the 2017–18 season.</u> On 10 April 2018, he scored from the penalty spot during a 3–0 Champions League win over FC Barcelona to help Roma overturn a 4–1 deficit from the first leg. The result was the joint-second largest comeback in the tournament's history and saw Roma advance to the semi-finals for the first time in the Champions League era.
       
       On 26 September 2018, <u>De Rossi made his <strong>600th</strong> appearance for Roma</u> in a 4–0 home win over Frosinone, becoming only the second player after Totti to reach this landmark.
       
       On 14 May 2019, Roma announced that they would not renew De Rossi's contract, and that he will leave the club at the end of the 2018–19 season, after 18 seasons with the team. He made his 616th and final appearance for the club on 26 May in a 2–1 home win over Parma, making him the club's second-most capped player of all time, after Totti.
